# Leukemia-Classification
## Abstract
Leukemia is a cancer affecting the blood-forming tissues, with acute and chronic types. Acute leukemia progresses rapidly and shows more severe symptoms compared to chronic leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer, is diagnosed through an automated process involving microscopic images of blood cells. The diagnosis begins by extracting features from these images using pre-trained CNN-based deep learning models, which help identify intricate patterns. Since these models generate a large number of features, feature selection methods are applied to filter out irrelevant or redundant features, leaving only the most critical ones. Finally, machine learning algorithms are used to classify the images, ensuring accurate and efficient diagnosis.
## Results and Conclusion
The project focused on selecting the most important features from pre-extracted deep learning features using ResNet50 from skin lesion images to improve the accuracy of medical image classification models. After applying various feature selection techniques, including correlation-based feature selection, mutual information-based feature selection, and recursive feature elimination, the results showed that the SVM model had the best performance in predicting the diagnosis of skin lesions with an accuracy of 89.9% and F1-score of 0.928. Moreover, the project demonstrated that selecting the most important features using feature selection techniques significantly improved the performance of the classification models compared to using all the features. This indicates that feature selection is an essential step in developing accurate medical image classification models.
